# Predict coffee quality with Machine Learning

This notebook presents the prediction of the quality of wine on the basis of various features such as the farm and beans metadata, or quality measures (flavor, aroma, etc.). This prospection is carried out with Python for data analysis, visualization and machine learning (ML).

This dataset is available for Arabica and Robusta coffees on Kaggle, coming from Coffee Quality Institute (CQI) in January, 2018. It consists of three CSV files:
 - *arabica_data_cleaned.csv*: species, owner, farm_name, variety, flavor, moisture, color, etc.
 - *robusta_data_cleaned.csv*: species, owner, farm_name, variety, flavor, moisture, color, etc.
